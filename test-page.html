                            Internal Hyperlink: <br> An internal link is any link from one page on your website to another page on your website. Both your users and search engines use links to find content on your website. Your users use links to navigate through your site and to find the content they want to find.

                            External Hyperlink: <br>
                            An external link is a hyperlink that points at (target) any domain other than the domain the link exists on (source). External links have a greater impact on search engine rankings than internal links because they are valued by search engines as external votes of confidence/popularity in a web page.

                            Bookmark: <br>
                            A bookmark is a place holder for a web page that will allow you quick access to that page instead of having to browse to it or search for it. Instead of typing a web page in Google, clicking the bookmark will direct you to that page immediately.

                        I coded this on my website and not on my google drive, so i did not include the screenshot of the google drive.
